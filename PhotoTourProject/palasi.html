        <p>The Royal Palace of Tonga, located in the capital city of Nukuʻalofa, is a historic symbol of the Tongan monarchy and its enduring traditions. 
            Built in 1867, this Victorian-style wooden structure served as the official residence of the Tongan royal family and stood as a testament to the country's rich cultural heritage. 
            Over the years, the palace has witnessed significant events in Tonga's history, reflecting both the pride and resilience of its people. 
            Despite facing the test of time and natural challenges, the Royal Palace remains a cherished emblem of Tonga's identity and royal legacy.
