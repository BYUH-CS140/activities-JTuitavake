                <p>The Haʻamonga ʻa Maui is a monumental stone trilithon located in Niutōua, on the eastern side of Tongatapu, Tonga. 
                Constructed in the 13th century during the reign of King Tuʻitātui, it is a significant symbol of Tonga's ancient heritage and engineering prowess.
                The structure consists of three massive coral limestone slabs, with two upright pillars supporting a horizontal lintel, 
                each weighing several tons. Historically, it is believed to have served as a royal gateway or throne for the King, symbolizing strength and unity among the people. 
                Legend ties its construction to Maui, a mythical Polynesian hero, further enhancing its cultural and spiritual significance. 
                Today, the Haʻamonga ʻa Maui stands as an enduring testament to Tonga’s rich history and a site of national pride and wonder.
                Further down the gateway is this piece of stone (to the right) said to be the stone throne of the King Tu'i ta Tui. 
                Here the blind king sat and if those who came to visit him did not come through the Ha'amonga, to him he saw as a threat. 
                He would protect himself with a long stick that would hit the knees of those that would try to assassinate him.
