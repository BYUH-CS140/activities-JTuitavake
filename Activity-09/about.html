    <p>On the planet Turo, Dr. Jumba Jookiba faces trial by the United Galactic Federation for conducting illegal genetic experiments. 
        He is found guilty of creating Experiment 626, a highly destructive and nearly indestructible creature with advanced intelligence. 
        While Jumba is imprisoned, 626 is sentenced to exile due to his dangerous nature. However, 626 escapes by hijacking a police cruiser 
        and using its hyperdrive to reach Earth, where he crash-lands on the Hawaiian island of Kaua’i. The Grand Councilwoman offers Jumba 
        freedom if he can recapture 626, assigning him an "Earth expert," Agent Pleakley, as a partner. Shortly after arriving, 626 crashes 
        into a wedding reception and is hit by a tourist trolley before being sent to an animal shelter.Meanwhile, a young Hawaiian girl 
        named Lilo Pelekai is expelled from her hula school for pushing her bully, Mertle, off the stage. Lilo’s frustration stems from her 
        sister Nani's frequent absence as she struggles to care for them. Their social worker, Mrs. Kekoa, visits and deems Nani unfit, 
        giving her one week to prove otherwise. The next day, Lilo expresses a desire for a friend, prompting their neighbor Tūtū to take 
        her to the animal shelter, where 626 is being held. Sensing danger from Jumba and Pleakley, 626 disguises himself as a dog and allows 
        Lilo to adopt him to stay safe. Nani reluctantly agrees, and Lilo names him "Stitch" after Nani mentions stitching up a torn car seat. 
        At Nani’s workplace, a resort lūʻau, Stitch’s antics accidentally start a fire, causing Nani to lose her job. Nani’s struggles 
        intensify when Mrs. Kekoa and Cobra Bubbles, a CIA agent posing as a social worker, visit again. Nani desperately seeks new employment, 
        but her efforts are thwarted by Stitch and Lilo's mischief. Eventually, Lilo helps Nani secure a job as a surfing instructor, and 
        they celebrate with a family outing. However, Stitch’s involvement draws Jumba and Pleakley into a chaotic pursuit, nearly resulting 
        in Lilo’s drowning. Following the incident, Mrs. Kekoa informs Nani that the Hawaiian government could cover health insurance if 
        she relinquishes custody of Lilo. Heartbroken, Nani agrees. That night, Stitch, reflecting on his destructive actions, leaves the 
        family and returns to the animal shelter. Meanwhile, the Grand Councilwoman cancels Jumba and Pleakley's mission after their 
        repeated failures. Jumba, however, defies orders and resolves to capture Stitch on his own. The next morning, Nani and Cobra discover 
        Lilo missing. While searching, Lilo encounters Stitch at the shelter. Jumba attacks, but they manage to escape to Lilo’s house, 
        where a battle ensues, leaving the home in ruins. Jumba reveals Stitch initially used Lilo for protection, prompting Stitch to 
        surrender in guilt. Jumba abducts Stitch onto his spaceship, intending to erase his empathy. Lilo sneaks aboard, freeing Stitch 
        before they eject Jumba. The ship crashes into the ocean, trapping Lilo and Stitch underwater. Stitch rescues Lilo but begins to 
        drown. Nani and David intervene, saving both Lilo and Stitch. David successfully revives Stitch with a makeshift defibrillator. 
        The Grand Councilwoman arrives and, recognizing Stitch's growth, decides to let him remain on Earth with his newfound 'ohana. 
        Jumba is re-arrested, but peace is restored. Mrs. Kekoa suggests that Lilo’s guardianship be transferred to David and Tūtū to allow 
        Nani to focus on her future. Together, the family rebuilds their home, and Nani pursues marine biology studies at the University of 
        California, San Diego, using Jumba’s portal gun to visit Lilo and Stitch in Kaua’i.
