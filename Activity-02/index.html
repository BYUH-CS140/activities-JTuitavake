            <p><strong>Tennis</strong> is <del>often</del> regarded as <del>one of the</del> <ins><b>THE</b></ins>
                <em>best sport in the world</em> due to its unique combination of physical challenge, mental strategy, and individual performance. 
            </p>
            <p>Unlike many team sports, tennis places full responsibility on the player, demanding focus, agility, and endurance. </p>
            <p>What sets tennis apart is its <mark>emphasis on mental fortitude.</mark> Players must remain composed under pressure, strategize their moves, and adapt quickly to their opponent’s tactics. 
                The mental demands of the game foster resilience, patience, and critical thinking—skills that are valuable both on and off the court.</p>
            <p>The constant need for decision-making during play makes tennis a mentally stimulating sport, often described as "physical chess.</p>
            
            </p>Tennis is also incredibly versatile and accessible. It can be played in singles or doubles formats, on a variety of surfaces—clay, grass, or hard courts—each influencing the game in different ways.</p>
            <p>This variation keeps the sport dynamic and offers continuous learning opportunities. Additionally, tennis is a lifelong sport. 
                People of all ages, from children to seniors, can play and compete at different levels, promoting a healthy, active lifestyle across generations.</p>
            <p>Another reason tennis stands out is its global appeal and rich history. It boasts prestigious tournaments like <b>Wimbledon, the US Open, the French
                Open, and the Australian Open,</b> which attract top athletes from around the world and captivate millions of fans. </p>
            <p id="targetParagraph">Finally, tennis fosters a sense of community. Clubs, school teams, and recreational leagues provide social opportunities and a shared passion for the game. Therfore tennis will always be the 1<sup>st</sup>  sport I turn to.
